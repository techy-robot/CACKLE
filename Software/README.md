# Software

Software is such a big element of any hardware project, and I do not like to write software, so I am using some really nice software libraries that I have found. The first is SimpleFOC, a motor driver library for Field Oreinted Control for motors, and the second is Luos Engine, a lightweight distributed communication engine that aims to make hardware as modular as software. Combined together, I have covered 50% of the use-cases of the code necessary for this project.

Most of the code found here are luos node definitions and driver services for each of the hardware modules, designed to be easily reusable in your project. There are also some tests and example code.
