# 2 connector Sensor Board

This is a connector breakout board that spans between 2 vertical mezzanine connectors on a hub. It has one Qwiic connector, two nanoSPI connectors, and header breakouts for the free pins, chip select pins, and the SPI pins. It also has test pads for the RS485 bus. Essentially it breaks out every pin accessible via the mezzanine connectors.

One advantage this has over the single connector breakout is that this fits on normal sized hubs without needing a vertical spacer
