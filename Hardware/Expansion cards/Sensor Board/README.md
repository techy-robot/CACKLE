# Sensor Board

This is a connector breakout board for vertical mezzanine connectors on a hub. It has one Qwiic connector, two nanoSPI connectors, and header breakouts for the free pins, chip select pins, and the SPI pins. Essentially it breaks out every pin accessible via the mezzanine connector.

Note that this does not fit the hubs by default because it sticks into the hub chaining headers. You will need a Vertical Spacer, or use the [2 connector sensor breakout](../2%20connector%20Sensor%20Board/README.md) instead, which does fit.
