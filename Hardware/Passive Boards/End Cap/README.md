# End Cap

The only purpose of this is to provide a nice end to the chain. It has rounded corners like the PSU at the beginning, and it also has a 120ohm termination resistor for the RS485 bus. You can skip using an end cap if you hand solder a termination resistor and tape up the driver edge connectors to prevent shorts.
