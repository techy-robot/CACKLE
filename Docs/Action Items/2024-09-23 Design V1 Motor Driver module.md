# Description:

# Comments:
- [x] I need to redo the power connector scheme, to make it work in reverse 180 orientation and to use the cheaper connectors. Reverse orientation capability would mean I need 4 connectors per edge. It *should* save time and hassle so that I don't have to produce a mirror board copy, but it will be costly. Another benefit is double the current capacity. ➕ 2024-10-14 ✅ 2024-10-21 ^1
