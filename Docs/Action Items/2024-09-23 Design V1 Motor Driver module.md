# Description:

# Comments:
- [ ] I need to redo the power connector scheme, to make it work in reverse 180 orientation and to use the cheaper connectors. Reverse orientation capability would mean I need 4 connectors per edge. It *should* save time and hassle so that I don't have to produce a mirror board copy, but it will be costly. Another benefit is double the current capacity. âž• 2024-10-14 ^1
