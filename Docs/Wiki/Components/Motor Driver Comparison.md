I want a FOC controller that is compact and not to expensive. Similar to [[Motor Comparison Table]], this is not in the task/goal system.

Helpful page for TI drivers: [Brushless DC (BLDC) motor drivers | TI.com](https://www.ti.com/motor-drivers/brushless-dc-bldc-drivers/overview.html)

# Position Control

FOC controllers already can detect relative position of a motor. However it is not that precise, and at slow speed useless. Since my motors will be on a reduction gear box, it should be fine. I will have to figure out absolute position anyway. 3d Hall effect sensors are an attractive option, because they don't need an encoder wheel.

Another option is designing a complex driver that can inject high-frequency pulses and measuring those to get absolute motor position.

# Types
Most of these chips still require output gate transistors.

- Integrated XXX. A chip that has everything already built in to drive. Replace XXX with the control algorithm. It may or may not be a FOC, but it still is standalone and space saving. 
- Normal cheap ESC.
- Driver. These have FETs and current sensors, but they still need a microchip to support. Has 3 PWM inputs usually
- Microcontroller [[Microcontroller Comparison]]. Useful for installing Simple FOC, it may be a good cheap option, but a microchip + driver takes up more space

## Top Picks:
- TI DRV8311.
- TI DRV10974. 

Both are cost effective. DRV10974 is more design compact, with a sinusoidal wave generation built in. Sinusoidal is the best thing below FOC control. It also is a little bit smaller, with 4 pins on each side

However the DRV8311 supports a voltage and current range more suitable for my application. The docs specifically state 1s-4s for mobile applications. Unbalanced 5x7 pin count. It supports SPI control(S variant, P variant for multi-device address selector), which will reduce a lot of pin count if it works. Maybe I can do FOC control over SPI, but this is a bit of a stretch. Note that the P variant has NO support for hardware, and vice-versa. I will have to buy two chip versions and test each to see how SPI FOC works. This may help[TMC6200 SPI With Simple FOC - hardware support - SimpleFOC Community](https://community.simplefoc.com/t/tmc6200-spi-with-simple-foc/4157/3) BTW the S variant IS NOT PRUCHASABLE.
