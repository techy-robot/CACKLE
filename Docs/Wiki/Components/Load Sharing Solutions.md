Article on designing power path using discrete components: [BQ24650: Power path design using BQ24650 - Power management forum - Power management - TI E2E support forums](https://e2e.ti.com/support/power-management-group/power-management/f/power-management-forum/756067/bq24650-power-path-design-using-bq24650)

The LTC44 series from Analog Devices seams like a good option. There also is the TI BQ series.

I'm looking for a controller that has something like DPPM (Dynamic Power-Path Management) from TI's DQ charger series. This prioritizes output current.

Another thing I may need is a Load switch IC or a hot swap controller.

# Power Path Chips:
All the chips on here must meet one requirement: Supports an external FET between battery and Vout

A lot of the medium complexity circuits have inductors on the power lines, and resistor voltage dividers for all the settings.

# Top Picks 
- LTC4088-2 Most expensive
-  ~~BQ24133~~ Doesn't support DPPM, where output current is prioritized
- bq25060. Single cell, simple
- BQ25730. Most complex. Requires i2c host for settings
- bq24780S. Requires SMbus host for settings. For hybrid boost the input current must be over 1.5 amps
- LTC4162-L Expensive ($7~9), but it only requires two mosfets, and some inductors. Supports i2c telementary, not required. Power path is unclear if the battery can supply current if the system is overloaded, see note.
- BQ24171 (ADD TO LIST) A cheap 2 dollar charger that is stand-alone. Requires 3 mosfets. Switches mode with a 200mV difference

It seems like for anything above 1 cell batteries I have to have a really complex circuit and an additional microchip to control it all. This is frustrating, that I can't find a standalone, cheap, DPPM or Hybrid Boost Mode battery charger chip with external FETs and support for several lipo cells and high amperage.

The ones that require a host also have very low regulator output currents. I mean, seriously 6volts at 13ma?!! I can't run a host very well on that. I did find a low current regulator that could work: TPS62745. The chip I chose for motor power seems to have low current consumption, but I think that would be pushing the limits when the peripheral is enabled. If I have to have a dedicated chip, I may go with the RP2040 to save cost.

**LTC4162-L**
> These drivers make up a dual unidirectional power path system that allows power to be delivered to the system load by either the input supply or the battery, whichever is greater

I think if the system draws too much current the voltage should drop and the system will switch over to the battery. The datasheet says 20mV is the threshold.
