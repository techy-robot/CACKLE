## Notes
The STM 32 G0x1 series seems to be the best budget option for chips, and most 64 pin chips have enough outputs to drive 4-5 motors. Cortex M0. $3.5~6

The price is higher for STM32 G4XXX, only the lowest option is 3.95 for 64 pin. This is good if I can operate a lot of motors.

Each motor needs 3 pwm out, and 3 adc lines for current sensing. Another unspecified requirement are pins for encoders, which I have not figured out. I will most likely be doing a 3d hall effect sensor over i2c or spi. You can drop a current sense line, but I don't know the performance impact.

All chips on the table have at least one SPI port. I have not identified which chips are easier to set up however.

Most chips are qfn 64, and 32 bit. I have not checked if all the outputs listed are available in that package format

STM32 chips are well supported in Simple FOC.

**My current choice:** stm32g070cb. **Reasons:** Supports 4 motors w/ simple config tweak, $0.64 a motor, supports a cheaper clock type, same size as 32 pin packages.

# Top Picks
- STM32G071RB
- STM32G0B1RC 
- stm32g070cb
- STM32U073CC
- STM32G474RC
- STM32G473RB
- ESP32-S3 with built in flash

## Findings from using STM-32 Cube MX for pin configs.
Note that cost is still per 10 units.


### STM32G071KB 
- 32 pin package 
- Max 10 ADC
- Max 10 PWM
- 1 i2c, 1 spi, 1 swd
- 2 extra gpio.
- Cost 2.85 Mouser
- 3 motors, 0.95 per motor
- 
### STM32G071RB 
- 64 pin package 
- Max 12 ADC
- Max 17 PWM
- All comms are able to run with this 2 i2c and 2 spi. USB is not on this chip.
- Cost 4.11
- 4 motors, 1.03 per motor

### STM32G0B1KC 
- 32 pin package, no leads.
- Max 9 ADC
- Max 9 PWM
- 1 i2c, 1 spi, 1 usb, and 1 SWD
- 3 extra GPIO, BOOT0 is conflicting. This is a very dense layout.
- cost $4.63. KB is 4.18, 1.39 a motor
- 3 motors, $1.54 a motor. Expensive with 256 kb flash, a little smaller package, USB capability and other features I don't need.
- DO NOT GET THE N version. It is impossible to get all outputs.
![[STM32G0B1KCUx.jpg|400]]
### STM32G0B1RC 
- 64 pin package 
- Max 12 ADC
- Max 21 PWM
- All comms are available except USB pwr delivery.
- Has USB-C pwr delivery and USB.
- cost $5.2
- 4 motors, $1.3 a motor

### stm32g070kb.
- 32 pin package 
- 9 ADC
- 10 PWM
- 1 I2c and 1 SPI, no usb, 1 SWD
- 3 GPIO pin free
- Cost $1.89
- 3 motors, $0.63 a motor
![[STM32G070KB.jpg|400]]

### stm32g070cb GOOD DEAL W/O USB
![[STM32G070CB.jpg|400]]
- 48 pin package 
- Max 12 adc
- Max 12 PWM (10w/o the config change below)
- All comms are available. No usb
- Cost $2.57
- 4 motor, $0.64 PPM (old: 3 motor support, $0.89 a motor)
- There is a confusing setting in STMCube MX called Sequencer. If this is set to not fully configurable, then two more ADC pins appear, and I can rearrange stuff to get 12 pwm pins. PPM would then be $0.64! Reading online forums it appears that the only thing that would change is setting different sampling rates for different channels, which I don't care about.
- This package is the same size as KB, except with finer pitch.
- Combined with a cheaper clock (Since I now have OSC in and out), I could actually save quite a few dimes!
UPDATE: With simplefoc you can only run 3 motors because not all timers support syncing. Also, the price changed to $2.01 !! That means it is $0.67 a motor

### stm32g070rb 
- 64 pin package 
- Max 12 adc
- Max 13 PWM
- All comms are available. No usb
- Cost $2.67
- 4 motor support, $0.67 a motor

### STM32U073CC 
- 48 pin package 
- Max 8 ADC pins
- Max of 14 PWM pins (Don't do N channels, which eliminates all communication interfaces besides SWD
- I can disable output from TIM1_CH4 to get USB, and TIM16_CH1 to get I2C1.
- I can disable TIM2_CH2, TIM3_CH1, and TIM3_CH2 to get SPI1.
- That leaves me with 9 PWM
- The ADC pins and the PWM pins stay in separate areas, broken up by communication interfaces
- cost ~~$3.03~~ $3.37
- 2 motors max, ~~$1.52~~ $1.69 a motor. Not a good deal. The 32 pin version also has 8 adc ports

UPDATE: I got it to 3 motors, which is $1.12 a motor.

### STM32U073RC. GOOD DEAL, Lot of space
- 64 pin package 
- Max 12 ADC pins
- Max 15 PWM pins
- 3 I2c and 2 SPI buses are available without disabling other pins, but USB needs TIM1_CH4 disabled like above.
- Cost $3.11
- 4 motors, $0.78

### STM32G474RC. BIG BOY
- Max 26 ADC
- Max 29 PWM
- Not all ADC and PWM can be on at once, and I need other communication interfaces. 
- If I enable USB, SPI3 and I2C1, and all other pins in various configurations, then I could have 20 ADC and 20 PWM. 
- Cost $7.47
- 6 motors a chip, $1.25 a motor. Not the best deal.
- It reduces the amount of chips, but I'm not sure about actual space savings because LQFP64 is 10mm x 10mm chip, vs 7mm of a LQFP48.

Config:
![[STM32G474RC.jpg|400]]

### STM32G473CB
- 48 pin
- Cost $6 per 10 at digikey
- Max 20 ADC
- Max 27 PWM
- Similar to above, it needs some playing around. With one usb, SPI, and I2c, I can have 13 ADC, and 14 PWM. This maximizes most of the pins
- 4 motors, $1.5 per motor, expensive
Config:
![[STM32G473CB.jpg|400]]

### ESP32-S3 

Yes, this is not an stm32 product. But it is still a top pick due to the price and capability
- 240 mhz dual core
- 12 pwm all through a dedicated motor interface 
- $2.28, $0.57 a motor
- 20 channels and two adcs
- Side note that it has fewer strapped pins than the original esp32
- I2c, spi, and USB.
- Very particular on some pins about behavior.

Helpful website for finding what all the pins do on power up, reset, etc... [Schematic Checklist - ESP32-S3 - — ESP Hardware Design Guidelines latest documentation](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-hardware-design-guidelines/en/latest/esp32s3/schematic-checklist.html)

Specifics: I need to use pins all on the same adc for Simplefoc

# Changelog:
- Migrated microcontrollers to this file from [[Motor Driver Comparison]]
- Reconsidered STM32G070cb as an option, with a simple config change I now get a better clock source option and 4 motor support.
- 2024-06-02 Added ESP32-S3 option
