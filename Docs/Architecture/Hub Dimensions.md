Each hub has 4 motor ports, with 1.27mm pin header sockets sticking past the edge of the board

The board should have two M2 screw holes in the board somewhere.

There are two mezzanine connectors receptors on the top, and two headers on the bottom. They are centered in each half of the board, so 8.5mm away from the edges. This provides room for the esp32 to be in the direct center, and it provides future opportunities such as 2 sensors per board, spanning sensor mounts between boards, or a half length 2 motor hub.
