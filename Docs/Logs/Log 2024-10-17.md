I've started the pcb routing and have discovered some issues.

I changed the schematic so that the Shift Register clock is also on a dual high/low glitching pins. I swapped out a test pad for a Free 2 pin, for the second expansion connector.

I2c w/ pullups will likely have problems with glitching on those first 20 pins, so I have shifted all the motor pwm pins down, and stuck the FREEx pins and the i2c pins near the end. Now, only the motor pins and the analog pins will have glitching. Since it is a low level glitch, and there are no pullups on those lines, it should be fine.
